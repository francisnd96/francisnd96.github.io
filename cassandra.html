            <h3>Cluster Topology and Design</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
            <li>A single Cassandra instance is called a node </li>
            <li>Cassandra supports horizontal scalability achieved by adding more that one node as part of a cassandra cluster</li>
            <li>Cassandra works with peer to peer to architecture with each node connected to all other nodes</li>
            <li>Each Cassandra node performs all database operations and can serve client requests without a need for a master node</li>
            <li>Nodes in a cluster communicate with each other via Seeds and Gossip</li>
            <li>Seeds - Each node configures a list of seeds which is simply a list of other nodes. A seed node is used to bootstrap a node when it is first joining a cluster</li>
            <li>Gossip - Gossip is the protocol used by Cassandra nodes for peer-to-peer communication. The gossip
            informs a node about the state of all other nodes</li>
            <li>A cluster is subdivided into racks and data centers. These terminologies are Cassandra's representation of
            a real world rack and data center</li>
        </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Database Structures</h3>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cassandra stores data in tables where each table is organised in rows and columns the same as any
                other database</li>
                <li>Tables are grouped in keyspaces. A keyspace could be used to group tables serving a similar purpose from
                a business perspective like all transactional tables, metadata tables, use information tables</li>
                <li>Each table has a defined primary key. The primary key is divided into partition key and clustering columns</li>
                <li>The partition key is used by Cassandra to index the data. All rows which share a common partition key make a
                single data partition which is the basic unit of data partitioning, storage and retrieval in Cassandra</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            </p>
            <h3>Partitioning</h3>
            <p>
            <ul>
            <li>A partition key is converted to a token by a partitioner</li>
            <li>The tokens are signed integer values between -2^63 to 2^63-1 and this range is referred to as token
            range</li>
            <li>Each Cassandra node owns a portion of this range and it primarily owns data corresponding to the range
            A token is used to prescisly locate the data among the nodes and on the data storage of the corresponding node</li>
            <li>Here is a simplified example to illustrate token range assignment. If we consider there are only 100 tokens used for a
            Cassandra cluster with three nodes. Each node is assigned approximately 33 tokens like ----- node1: 0-33 ----- node2: 34-66 ----- node3: 67-99</li>
        </ul>
